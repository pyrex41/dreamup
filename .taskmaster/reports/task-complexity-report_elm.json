		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Elm Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks covering dependency installation, build tool configuration, and basic Elm architecture implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple steps including installing dependencies, configuring build tools like Vite or webpack, and setting up the Elm Architecture with routing and CORS handling. It's foundational but requires familiarity with Elm and build tools, making it moderately complex with some technical challenges in integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Test Submission Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the interface implementation into subtasks for form creation, validation logic, and submission handling with API integration.",
			"reasoning": "Building a form with validation, optional settings, and HTTP requests involves UI design, client-side logic, and error handling. The effort includes testing various inputs and states, adding moderate complexity due to the need for robust validation and API interaction."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add Test Execution Status Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the status tracking into subtasks for polling mechanism, UI progress indicators, localStorage integration, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing real-time updates via polling or WebSockets, combined with UI elements like progress bars and persistence, introduces challenges in handling asynchronous operations and resilience. Testing requires simulating various states, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Report Display",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the report display into subtasks for header and summary, metrics visualization, collapsible sections, actions, and JSON decoding.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive view with multiple components like progress bars, collapsible elements, and actions requires significant UI effort and JSON handling. High complexity due to the need for detailed rendering, color-coding, and testing across different data scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Screenshot Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the screenshot viewer into subtasks for image loading, view modes (side-by-side, overlay, difference), controls, and metadata display.",
			"reasoning": "Developing visual comparison tools using canvas API for overlays and differences, along with lazy loading and zoom controls, poses technical challenges in image processing and performance. Testing on various devices adds to the effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Console Log Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the log viewer into subtasks for log display, filtering and search, virtual scrolling, and export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Handling large datasets with virtual scrolling, debounced search, and syntax highlighting requires optimization for performance. Complexity is high due to the need for efficient rendering and accurate statistics, with extensive testing for large logs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Test History and Search",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the history feature into subtasks for API fetching, table implementation, sorting and filtering, and pagination.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a paginated table with sorting, filtering, and navigation involves API integration and UI state management. Moderate to high complexity from handling large lists and ensuring performance, with testing for various query scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Polish UI/UX, Error Handling, and Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the polishing task into subtasks for UI styling and responsiveness, accessibility compliance, error handling and retries, performance optimization, and deployment setup.",
			"reasoning": "This broad task encompasses styling, accessibility, error handling across the app, performance tuning, and deployment. High complexity due to the need for cross-browser testing, audits, and optimization, with dependencies on multiple prior tasks."
