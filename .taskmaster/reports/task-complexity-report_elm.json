			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Elm Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks are already well-defined covering initialization, build tool setup, and basic architecture implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a new Elm project with multiple dependencies, configuring a build tool (Vite or webpack), and implementing core Elm Architecture with routing and CORS. It has moderate complexity due to integration of various tools and packages, potential version conflicts, and ensuring compilation. Testing requires verifying builds and basic functionality. The existing 3 subtasks adequately break it down."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Test Submission Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks cover form UI, validation, and submission logic comprehensively.",
			"reasoning": "Building a form with validation, optional settings, and API integration in Elm is straightforward but requires careful handling of user inputs, HTTP requests, and state management. Complexity arises from client-side validation using elm/url and managing loading states. Testing involves UI interactions and API mocks. The 3 subtasks are sufficient."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add Test Execution Status Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks address polling, UI indicators, persistence, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing real-time status tracking with polling, progress bars, localStorage, and error handling adds complexity due to asynchronous operations, state persistence, and UI updates. Dependencies on previous tasks and handling WebSocket fallback increase effort. Testing requires simulating API responses and persistence. The 4 subtasks cover all aspects well."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Report Display",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks include header, metrics, collapsible sections, actions, and JSON decoding.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive report view with various sections, visualizations, and interactions involves Elm/HTML rendering, JSON decoding, and UI components. Moderate complexity from color-coding, collapsible elements, and action handlers. Testing with sample data ensures accuracy. The 5 subtasks provide a solid breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add Screenshot Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks cover lazy loading, view modes, zoom/full-screen, and metadata display.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a visual comparison tool with canvas API for overlays and differences, lazy loading from S3, zoom controls, and full-screen mode is technically challenging due to image processing and browser APIs. Performance with large images and cross-device testing add effort. The 4 subtasks are appropriately detailed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Console Log Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks handle display, filtering/search, virtual scrolling, and export.",
			"reasoning": "Building a performant log viewer with filtering, search, virtual scrolling for large datasets, and export functionality requires handling DOM performance and debouncing. Syntax highlighting and statistics add minor complexity. Testing with large datasets is key. The 4 subtasks are comprehensive."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Test History and Search",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks include API fetching, table component, sorting/filtering, and pagination.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a paginated, sortable, and filterable table with API integration and navigation involves Elm's Http, table rendering, and state management. Moderate complexity from query params, date handling, and performance with large lists. The 4 subtasks cover implementation thoroughly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Polish UI/UX, Error Handling, and Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as subtasks address styling, accessibility, error handling, performance, and deployment.",
			"reasoning": "Polishing UI with responsive design, accessibility compliance, robust error handling with retries, performance optimizations, and static site deployment to S3/CloudFront involves multiple disciplines. High effort due to audits, cross-browser testing, and deployment configuration. The 5 subtasks are well-structured."
